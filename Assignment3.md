# Python List Operations Assignment

## Instructions
- Answer the following questions by writing Python code. 
- Ensure that your code is well-commented and correctly formatted.
- Test your code to verify it works as expected.

### Question 1: List Creation and Accessing Elements
Create a list of the first 10 positive integers. Write code to:
1. Print the entire list.
2. Print the first and last elements of the list.
3. Print the element at the 5th index.

### Question 2: Mutability of Lists
Given the list `numbers = [10, 20, 30, 40, 50]`:
1. Change the second element to 25.
2. Change the last element to 55.
3. Print the modified list.

### Question 3: List Traversing
Write a program to traverse the list `fruits = ['apple', 'banana', 'cherry', 'date', 'elderberry']` and print each fruit in uppercase.

### Question 4: List Functions
Given the list `data = [5, 3, 8, 6, 7, 2]`, write code to:
1. Find and print the length of the list.
2. Find and print the maximum and minimum values in the list.
3. Calculate and print the sum of all elements in the list.

### Question 5: List Manipulation and Conditions
Given the list `scores = [85, 62, 75, 90, 88, 76, 95, 89, 60, 77]`, write code to:
1. Add a new score 82 at the end of the list.
2. Remove all scores less than 70.
3. Print the updated list.
4. Check if the score 95 is in the list and print an appropriate message.

### Question 6: Sorting and Reversing a List
Create a list of 7 random integers. Write code to:
1. Sort the list in ascending order and print it.
2. Reverse the list and print it.

### Question 7: List Comprehensions and Nested Lists
1. Use list comprehensions to create a list of squares of the first 10 positive integers.
2. Create a nested list where each sublist contains the square and cube of numbers from 1 to 5. Print the nested list.

### Question 8: Using built-in functions
Given the list `temperatures = [72, 68, 75, 70, 69, 80, 78, 74, 73, 71]`, write code to:
1. Calculate and print the average temperature.
2. Create a new list that contains only the temperatures that are above the average temperature.
3. Print the list of temperatures above average.
